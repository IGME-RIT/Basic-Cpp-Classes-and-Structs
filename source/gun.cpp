#include <iostream>


#include "..\header\gun.h"  // This cpp file will include the matching header file.
                            // The convention for classes is to have declarations in the header, and definitions in the source file.
                            // This way, we can include the header anywhere, and use the functions before they are defined.
                            // When the cpp files are compiled, they define the functions that have already been declared in the headers.


// Function Definition
// The function definition is actually outside of the class definition.
// That's why we use the scope resolution operator ::
void Gun::Fire()
{
    if (mag.bullets > 0)
    {
        // If there are bullets, fire the gun.
        std::cout << "BANG!" << std::endl;

    }
    else
    {
        // If there are no bullets, click instead.
        std::cout << "click" << std::endl;
    }
}
