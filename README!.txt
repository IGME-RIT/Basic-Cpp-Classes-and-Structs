Welcome to the Classes and Structs Tutorial!
Prerequesites: Header Files

In this tutorial we will show you how to make a Structure for a "magazine",
and how to make a Class for a "gun". Structures and classes are very 
similar, and accomplish the same goal: They both put variables 
together into a group. Whether you use a class or a struct is 100%
a matter of preference, they both do the same thing. 

The only difference between a class and a struct:
-	Variables in a struct will default as "public" variables, 
	but you can make them "private" if you want to.
-	Variables in a class will default as "private" variables, 
	but you can make them "public" if you want to.	
	
Out of all the people in the world that use C++, the majority
of people use classes instead of structs
