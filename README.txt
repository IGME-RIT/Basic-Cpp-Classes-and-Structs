This tutorial was designed for Visual Studio 2017 / 2019

to a different version of the Windows SDK. If you do not
have any version of the Windows SDK, it can be installed
from the Visual Studio Installer Tool

Welcome to the Classes and Structs Tutorial!
Prerequesites: Header Files

In this tutorial we will show you how to make a Structure for a "magazine",
and how to make a Class for a "gun". Structures and classes are very 
similar, and accomplish the same goal: They both put variables 
together into a group. Whether you use a class or a struct is 100%
a matter of preference, they both do the same thing. 

The only difference between a class and a struct:
-	Variables in a struct will default as "public" variables, 
	but you can make them "private" if you want to.
-	Variables in a class will default as "private" variables, 
	but you can make them "public" if you want to.	
	
Out of all the people in the world that use C++, the majority
of people use classes instead of structs
